# logistic_regression

You will need the following to run the code in the notebook:
  * Python, the easiest would be [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
    * [Numpy](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy)
    * [Matplotlib](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/matplotlib)
    * [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
    * [Statsmodels](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/statsmodels)
 
 Some of the latex math does not render properly on Github. You will need to clone this repository and run the notebook locally for proper rendering.
